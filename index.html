                    <p>
                       The essence of the game is to find various cats hidden across all kinds of imaginable and unimaginable locations.
                       The cats you find are stored in an encyclopedia, where you can inspect each cat at any time and read its unique description.
                       Found cats can also be equipped as pets so you can admire them. At the moment, there are 65 cats in the game, and each of them has its own rarity,
                       which indicates how difficult it is to find. There are 6 rarities:

                            An unidentified cat lives on Uranus. He was born into a non-earthly race—not because of the Scientist Cat. Once a month, at night, they steal bulls (not cows, mind you), claiming it helps them with mineral extraction. (Don’t ask.) In general, he steals whatever he can from our island—one time it’s a microwave, another time some magnets—and drags it all back to his planet. On their planet, working as a galactic protractor operator is actually a very elite job. (Give him some credit—he did study hard at Uranus University.)

                            A true rival to Spite Cat in terms of anger. He became rectangular-shaped after eating a square watermelon, which stayed inside him forever. He has aggressive traits—usually shoving other cats and yelling when encountered. And on January 28th, he and Spite Cat begin an aggressive battle (basically like a rap battle, but with insults), while the other cats watch. (The current score is 28–30.)

He’s into painting (as if you didn’t notice), and he sells his works for a good amount of Cat Coins—despite spending minimal time and materials on them. Once, he sold a single brushstroke on toilet paper for 56,000 Cat Coins, claiming it was modern art. And when there’s actually a high-quality drawing, it was done by ChatGPT.

                            A legendary cat of history, he survived the Cat War, which left a scar over his right eye. His axe is like a dog to him—he carries it everywhere, loves it dearly, and would defend it with his life. All the psychologists say he’s having post-war flashbacks and believes the wood of the axe is actually his old teammate. This happens every time he hears a creak, which is why he sleeps in an old shed somewhere out in the ocean.

                            Also a cat created by accident. One lazy cat asked a scientist to make an infinite battery for his remote so he could watch TV all the time and never have to get off his sweaty couch. But instead, the battery ran off from the remote and started hiding because it got tired of being grabbed by his dirty paws. Despite that, he's just a cool guy who dreams of becoming a baseball player in America.

                            A battle-hardened cat, he served for about two years in the feline army. He stood guard as a regular soldier, camouflaged in military gear. Like AxeCat, he was deeply affected by the war and now suffers from hallucinations related to it. He believes he’s still on the battlefield and hides as a bush in combat zones. To “win,” he uses an imaginary stick-knife and aggressively charges at others, whacking them with his trusty stick.

They threw him inside and sealed the door forever. But inside the capsule sits not a cat anymore, but a dead body—since he couldn’t eat, and the air was limited. But honestly, he doesn’t really care. He’s just a chill dude who enjoys life.

A lifetime supply of cat food. Sadly, he doesn’t remember how much time has passed since then, having lost his mind. Supposedly, it’s been 23 days.

                            One of the cats born from ancient artifact-eggs. (N101) He honors the lives of delivery workers who lived long ago, and now he delivers goods to the market — sometimes fragile items, sometimes food, sometimes metals. His main rival and counterpart is Killer Cat, but his element is Red (not Black), dealing massive damage (21,165 units). He lives on a small salary in a two-room apartment in the city.

                            The funny thing is, it's not a cat modified into a crab—it's just a cat inside a crab shell. (It might seem strange, and it is strange.) The builder cats and the scientist cat could help him get out, but he doesn’t want to. He says, “It’s warm in there and feels like home.” Besides, he didn’t crawl into just any crab, but into the king crab himself, and now he has the right to command the regular crabs. They regularly bring him treats and fan him with leaves nearby.

                            The cat appeared as a result of a shot fired from the Scientist Cat's modified weapon. He was standing too close when she activated it, and the blast transformed him into a crystalline rock-like form. Now, whenever someone tries to reverse the mutation, the beam simply reflects off his surface — because his body is like crystal, almost like glass. He can only hope that one day someone will find a way to bring him back. He has no legs, so he can't walk — he just stands there, half-buried in the ground.

That was until a radioactive leak completely dissolved him. He was reborn as a demon due to his bad karma. He rose through the ranks in Hell and is now powerful and feared — the top boss down there.

Since then, he has remained that way, unable to change it. He often steals from shops, and critiques art at exhibitions. (His sprite was drawn just for you as he's invisible)

He wears a vintage bow tie, his favorite sweater, and was originally supposed to say: “Let’s all live in harmony.” But over time, he burned out and changed.

                            The richest cat of all—he’s wealthier than the merchant cat himself. He started a business empire spanning all the islands of the world, dealing in highly profitable stocks and selling oil from hidden treasure troves. He loves money just as much as Mr. Krabs does. If you’re curious, his cloak and hat alone are worth around 5 billion CatCoins. He has a strict personality and *never* forgets debts—that’s why his collectors knock the nonsense out of any cats who owe him.

                            He’s genuinely sad and gloomy, a serious rival to Isaac the cat in terms of sorrow. He loves the meme with the frog so much that he wanted to become it—he cried at its image and soon became a meme himself. All the other cats are trying to help him, to listen to him, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Maybe you could try helping him too?

He tried turning into sand… and it worked! But now he can’t quite figure out how to turn back. Still, he scatters in a really fun way and swells up when water hits him. He can take on any shape you can imagine

                            The most brilliant cat of them all — he’s the one who created various devices to modify other cats. He became this smart thanks to the MB350-A serum, which he stole from a top-secret national scientific archive. His IQ exceeds 350 and is still growing. He conducts all his research for the greater good, trying to discover a new planet and name it after himself, because according to his calculations, Earth will become uninhabitable in 3 years, 12 days, and 7 hours.

He often loses his scissors and spends hours searching for them. The worst part for him is when his blades are sharpened—it’s incredibly painful, believe me

                            The laziest cat of all—even the Fat cat is more active, though at least he can make it to a restaurant. He’s supposed to go to work, but after that village party, all he wants is sleep. To make sure he’d never have to wake up again, he forced someone to inject him with the strongest tranquilizer available. Since then, he hasn’t woken up. It’s been about a year now. When other cats see the majestic bags under his eyes, they just find him peacefully sleeping... with a smile...

All the other cats are terrified of him because his eyes look like Killer Cat’s… but he has four of them. (In fact, all cats try to avoid him.) Even the scientist cat, who’s usually curious about feline anatomy, prefers to stay away.

You know, you really shouldn’t bully someone just because they don’t fit in with the herd. (He isn't a actually tank).
